    question: 'Why should I utilize the content on MDS versus a professional sports psychology website?',
    answer: 'We are the only sports psychology organization governed by students that play sports so we have a perspective that is directly applicable to younger athletes. The writing in the blogs and the questions asked in the podcasts will reflect that and allow younger athletes to take away the most applicable information to help them perform their best . The majority of other sports psychology websites use extremely sophisticated language without taking into account how younger athletes will utilize the information and some are also targeted towards parents for their kids rather than directly to the kids.'
