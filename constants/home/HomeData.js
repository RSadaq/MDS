        'The founder of Mind-Design Sports, Brandon, has always been physically active and loves sports, playing basketball and running track for many years. He is also very interested in psychology and its applications in everyday life, particularly cognitive and social psychology. Like many other student-athletes, he never realized that the mental game is as crucial as the physical game in giving athletes an edge in sports performance. This is the reason he created Mind-Design Sports, combining his interests to help athletes improve their bodies and minds in sports. Unlike other organizations, Mind-Design Sports is designed by teens, for teens and kids. With social distancing in place, this online platform is especially relevant to provide the attention and resources that student-athletes need to set themselves up for success. Design your best sports experience using the power of the mind!',

        '“Design” comes from the Latin word “designare,” which means to draw a plan. Use sport psychology techniques to develop a plan for peak performance. ',
        '“Sport" comes from the Old French word “desport,” which means leisure. Remember that sports are supposed to be for fun! ',
