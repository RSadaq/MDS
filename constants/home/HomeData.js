        'The founder of Mind-Design Sports, Brandon, has always been physically active and loves sports, playing basketball and running track for many years. He is also very interested in psychology and its applications in everyday life, particularly cognitive and social psychology. Like many other student-athletes, he never realized that the mental game is as crucial as the physical game in giving athletes an edge in sports performance. This is the reason he created Mind-Design Sports, combining his interests to help athletes improve their bodies and minds in sports. Unlike other organizations, Mind-Design Sports is designed by teens, for teens and kids.',
