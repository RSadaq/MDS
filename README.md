# MDS
MDS React-native app

* Remember to run 'npm install' when you first clone the repo - this will install all dependencies.

* If you have the expo CLI installed on your machine already, use 'expo start' to run the app. If you do not have the expo CLI, use 'npm start' 
  and you will be asked whether you want to install the expo CLI, install it to run the app.
  
* Ensure your code is written in the correct file (e.g. code for the initial screen needs to be written in HomeScreen.js) and NOT App.js.
  Please DO NOT add code to App.js. 

* When you commit changes, this should be done on a new branch (so the main branch always remains deployable) & you will need to create a 'pull request'.
  If there are no conflicts, your branch will be merged into the main.
